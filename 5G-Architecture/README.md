# 5GNR - Architecture and Interfaces

The objective of this session is to understand what the main elements of the 5G architecture are. The idea is also to introduce the different protocols used at the Radio level. These elements will be discussed theoretically and then through a practical application.

## 1. Theoretical analysis

The idea is to understand what the main components are and the main differences between 4G and 5G architectures.

### LTE Architecture

**Q.11 Using the image above, identify the four main components that make up a 4G architecture. What is the EPS?**

**Q.12 What is E-UTRAN? What is its role?** (potential source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lte/lte_network_architecture.htm)

**Q.13 Using the above image, indicate what are the main functions of the EPC? What is the role of each of these functions?** (potiential source: https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/lte-architecture/) 

**Q.14 What is the PCEF? The PCRF? Why Quality of Service (QoS) is an important element?** (Potential source: https://yatebts.com/solutions_and_technology/lte-epc/)

**Q.15 What is the role of the EPC? The role of the E-UTRAN?** (potiential source: https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/lte-architecture/)


### 5G Architecture

**Q.17 What are the main functions of the 5G Core? What are the main differences compared to the EPC? Why did these functions evolved as that?** (potential sources: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discover-5g-core-network-functions-compared-4g-lte-paul-shepherd/)

**Q.18 What is the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA)? What is the advantage of such an approach?** (potential source: https://www.metaswitch.com/knowledge-center/reference/what-is-the-5g-service-based-architecture-sba)

**Q.19 What could be the benefits of decentralized 5G Core Functions?** (potential source: https://www.digi.com/blog/post/5g-network-architecture)

**Q.20 What is the different between a StandAlone (SA) and a Non-StandAlone (NSA) 5G Architecture? What are the differences between each of this solution?What are the solution the most deployed currently (NA or NSA)?** (potential source: https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/feature/5G-NSA-vs-SA-How-does-each-deployment-mode-differ ; potential source: https://www.counterpointresearch.com/5g-sa-core-deployments/)
