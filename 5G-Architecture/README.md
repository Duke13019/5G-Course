# 5GNR - Architecture and Interfaces

The objective of this session is to understand what the main elements of the 5G architecture are. The idea is also to introduce the different protocols used at the Radio level. These elements will be discussed theoretically and then through a practical application.

## 1. Theoretical analysis

The idea is to understand what the main components are and the main differences between 4G and 5G architectures.

### LTE Architecture

**Q.11 Using the image above, identify the four main components that make up a 4G architecture. What is the EPS?**

**Q.12 What is E-UTRAN? What is its role?** (potential source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lte/lte_network_architecture.htm)

**Q.13 Using the above image, indicate what are the main functions of the EPC? What is the role of each of these functions? What is the PCEF?** (potiential source: https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/lte-architecture/) 

**Q.14 What is the role of the EPC? The role of the E-UTRAN?** (same potential source as above)

### 5G Architecture

**Q.11**

**Q.12**


### LTE Radio Interface Protocols

### 5G Radio Interface Protocols


## 2. Let's use it: Open5GS and UERANSIM

**Q.21 What is Open5GS? What is UERANSIM? Why these tools need to be used together**

### 2.1 Setting up virtual machines

### 2.2 Trying a first communication
